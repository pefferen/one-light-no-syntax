## One Light No Syntax theme

In my search to a distraction free workspace, i found the no-syntax theme to be
nice since it does not have strong syntax hignlighting. Only strings and comments
are highlightd, all code has the same colour.

## todo

- rewrite documentation
- add references to sources
- link to article
- link to no-syntax theme
- use no-syntax color scheme
- replace screenshot

> The font used in the screenshot is [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira).

There is also a matching [UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-light-ui).

### Install

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting it from the __Syntax Themes__ drop-down menu.
